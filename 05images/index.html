        <h1>Natural Nails</h1>
        <h2>Natural vs Artificial</h2>
        <p>Natural nails and artificial nails each have their own advantages and appeal, depending on personal
            preference and lifestyle. Natural nails, made of keratin, can be strong and healthy with proper care,
            including regular trimming, moisturizing, and avoiding harsh chemicals. They offer a more natural look and
            feel but may be prone to breakage if not maintained properly. On the other hand, artificial nails, such as
            acrylics, gels, and dip powders, provide durability and aesthetic versatility, allowing for longer lengths
            and intricate designs. However, they require professional application and maintenance, and prolonged use can
            weaken the natural nails underneath. Ultimately, the choice between natural and artificial nails depends on
            an individual’s priorities—whether they value low-maintenance, natural beauty, or long-lasting, customizable
            styles.</p>
        <p>While artificial nails offer convenience and style, it’s important to give natural nails time to breathe
            between applications to prevent damage. Regular hydration, a balanced diet, and proper nail care routines
            can help maintain nail health, whether you choose to keep them natural or enhance them with artificial
            options. Finding a balance between beauty and nail care ensures strong, beautiful nails in the long run.</p>

        <h2>What is Soft Gel</h2>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Flexible Gel-Based Nail Enhancement</strong> – Soft gel is a lightweight, flexible nail coating
                made from a gel
                formula that is cured under a UV or LED lamp, providing a more natural feel compared to hard gel or
                acrylics.</li>
            <li><strong>Soak-Off Formula</strong> – Unlike hard gel, soft gel can be easily removed by soaking in
                acetone, making it a
                gentler option that reduces damage to the natural nails.</li>
            <li><strong>Used for Overlays and Extensions</strong> – Soft gel is commonly used as an overlay to
                strengthen natural nails
                or as full-coverage gel tips for extensions, offering durability while maintaining a thinner, more
                natural look.
