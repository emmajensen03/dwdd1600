        <h2>Brands</h2>
        <p>Here are some of the most popular brands for both soft gel and hard gel nails:</p>
        <dl>
            <dt>DND </dt>
            <dd>"DND nails" refers to nail polish products from the brand "Daisy Nail Design" (DND), which is known for
                its high-quality gel nail polishes, often used in salons, recognized for their wide color selection,
                long-lasting wear, and cruelty-free formulation; essentially, it's a popular choice for professional gel
                manicures. </dd>
            <dt> LUXA</dt>
            <dd>"Luxa Nails" refers to a brand of gel nail polish and nail products manufactured by LuxaPolish, a
                California-based company that specializes in professional-grade nail products like gel colors, base
                coats, top coats, and sculpting gels, known for their high quality and focus on creating durable,
                long-lasting manicures; particularly notable is their "Luxa Matrix" sculpting gel which allows for easy
                nail extensions with a gel-like consistency that sculpts like acrylic without the strong odor or need

        <p>Whether you prefer soft gel for its flexibility and easy removal or hard gel for its durability and strength,
            both options offer unique benefits to suit different nail needs. Soft gels are ideal for those looking for a
            natural feel with easy maintenance, while hard gels provide a strong and long-lasting solution for
            extensions and overlays. Choosing the right product depends on your lifestyle, nail health, and desired
            look. With high-quality brands available for both types, achieving beautiful and resilient nails has never
            been easier.</p>
